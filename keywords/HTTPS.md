**HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)** is an extension of **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** that uses encryption to secure data exchanged between a user's browser and a web server. Through **SSL/TLS** protocols, it ensures data confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.

**Netscape** developed HTTPS in 1994 to secure online transactions for its browser. Initially, it used **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)** for encryption. Over time, SSL was replaced by **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**, a more secure and efficient protocol. HTTPS became essential as online commerce and sensitive data exchanges grew, gaining widespread adoption in the 2000s and now a standard for safe browsing.
