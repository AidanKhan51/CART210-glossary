## Git

Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other's contributions.[^chacon14progit]

Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. The name ”Git” is British slang for a foolish or worthless person, which Torvalds humorously acknowledged, stating, “I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself. First 'Linux', now 'git'.”[^torvalds05kernel]

In new media studies, Git is significant because it facilitates collaborative content creation and management. Its distributed nature allows creators from various locations to contribute to a project, promoting decentralized and collaborative workflows. This aligns with the principles of new media, which emphasize participatory culture and collective intelligence.[^jenkins06convergence]

Git underpins many modern development workflows and platforms. Services like [GitHub](../main/glossary.md#github), GitLab, and Bitbucket build upon Git to provide hosting, collaboration tools, and project management features. These platforms are integral to open-source projects, content management systems, and even digital art collaborations, reflecting Git's broad applicability in current media practices.

A paradigmatic example of Git use is the Linux Kernel Development. Git was initially developed by Linus Torvalds for managing the Linux kernel's source code. The original thread for defining the protocol is [still available](https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/4/6/121).
