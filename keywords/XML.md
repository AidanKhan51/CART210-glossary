**XML (Extensible Markup Language)** is a flexible, text-based format for storing and transporting data. It uses a set of rules for encoding documents in a human-readable and machine-readable format.

The **World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)** developed XML in the late 1990s to address the need for a universal data format on the Internet. It was officially released in 1998 as a simplified version of **SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language)**, aiming to make data more portable across platforms and applications. Over time, XML became integral for web services, configuration files, and data storage.
