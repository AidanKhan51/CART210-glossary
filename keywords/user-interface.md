## User Interface (UI)
A user interface (UI) is the medium through which humans interact with devices. It includes physical tools like keyboards and touchscreens as well as visual elements such as icons, buttons and animations. Some more concrete example include a computer mouse, remote control and virtual reality headsets.[^hashemi24ui]

### History of UI
Early humans used hieroglyphs to communicate. They are universally understood symbols and modern UI design uses this practice with its emphasis on icons and emojis to indicate an action. The typewriter was a pivotal innovation during the age of the machine as it introduced a tactile user interface. This later influenced the design of computer keyboards and digital text interfaces.[^reidworld] However, more concrete work on the user interface began with the development of a graphical user interface (GUI) based on Douglas Engelbart’s work on interactive computing in 1968. He was inspired by calls for technological advancements to do social good after World War II. Xerox PARC further refined GUI concepts, leading to commercial adaptations like Apple's Macintosh and Microsoft Windows. These innovations made computing from a command-line system that was only accessible to experts into a more intuitive and visual experience for everyday users. However, commercial interests began to influence user interface design. The priority is ease of use and market dominance over the original vision of deeper human-computer interactions.[^barnes10history]

### UI Today
User interface (UI) is essential in today's increasingly digital world because it determines how users interact with technology. UI is directly tied to modern digital experiences. With the shift from Web 1.0 to Web 3.0, interfaces have adapted to allow more participation and personalization. Now, UI has advanced to natural user interfaces (NUI), which include voice commands, motion gestures and even biological signal recognition. This allows for more human-like interactions with technology. UI is evolving in industries like gaming, mobile devices and smart applications as human needs change.[^sharma21ui] It does so based on user experience which is another facet of human-computer interaction.[^hashemi24ui]
