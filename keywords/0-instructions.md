# Glossary of keywords related to new media.

The following list of keywords related to new media is constantly updated by the CART210 community throughout the term.

Each student is responsible for choosing and maintaining a set of three keywords. You will research about, define, and exemplify these terms. Your task involves improving the concepts throughout the term. 

For each keyword, cite at least three references. Ensure that at least two of these are from **academic sources**, such as journal articles, books, or conference papers. Citations must follow the Chicago author-year format.
