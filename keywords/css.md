## CSS

The Cascading Style Sheet or the CSS for short, is one of the components of building a website alongside with HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and JS (Javcascript). Some people (according to the wiki), the three form "the cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web".[^ebersbach01css] 

CSS is the language used for styling an HTML document. It is often described as defining the visual elements of HTML on screen devices[^ebersbach02css]. In other words, the language is reponsible of handling visuals, such as text color, background, buttons, UI elements, and much more. These features are seen on all websites. It is also reponsible of the interactivity hovers of cards and button and optimization visuals from small smartphones to large desktop monitors. Many people compare CSS to the skin of the HTML skeleton[^ebersbach03css], or as I like to say, the sweet icing on the cake.
