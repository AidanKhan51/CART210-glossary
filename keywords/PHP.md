**PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor)** is a widely used, open-source scripting language designed primarily for web development. It is embedded into HTML to create dynamic web pages and can interact with databases, manage sessions, and process forms. 

PHP was created in 1993 by **Rasmus Lerdorf** as a set of **Common Gateway Interface (CGI)** scripts to track visitors to his online resume. Initially called "Personal Home Page Tools," it evolved into **PHP/FI (Personal Home Page / Forms Interpreter)** in 1995. By 1997, it became the fully-fledged PHP language. PHP 3, released in 1998, marked its first major version, and it has continuously evolved with regular updates to improve performance, security, and functionality.
