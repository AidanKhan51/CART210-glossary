## UNIX

UNIX is a multiuser, multitasking operating system developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s at AT&T's Bell Labs by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others. Known for its simplicity, portability, and powerful capabilities, UNIX has been influential in the development of many modern operating systems.[^raymond03art]

UNIX was created at AT&T's Bell Labs in the late 1960s by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others. The name “UNIX” is a pun on “Multics,” an earlier operating system project, reflecting its creators' intent to develop a simpler, more streamlined system.[^salus94quarter]

In new media studies, UNIX is significant because it provides a stable and flexible platform for various digital media applications. Its design principles have influenced the development of tools and systems that support multimedia processing, web hosting, and content creation. The UNIX philosophy of building simple, modular tools that can be combined in complex ways aligns with the collaborative and participatory nature of new media.[^mcilroy78unix]

Many contemporary operating systems, such as Linux and macOS, are derived from or influenced by UNIX. These systems are widely used in media production, web development, and other digital content creation fields. The command-line interface and scripting capabilities of UNIX allow for efficient processing and manipulation of media files, making it a preferred choice for professionals in the industry.

## Analytics

Analytics refers to “the systematic computational analysis of data or statistics.”[^analyticsoxford] In new media, analytics involves the collection, measurement, and interpretation of digital interactions such as user engagement on websites, social media platforms, and streaming services to understand audience behavior and optimize content strategies.[^dong24study]

Digital platforms rely on analytics to personalize content, optimize marketing campaigns, and improve user engagement. By analyzing trends in user behavior, media companies can refine their strategies to increase audience retention and monetization[^dong24study]. Cultural analytics, as conceptualized by Lev Manovich, extends these principles to the study of digital culture, using computational techniques to analyze large-scale patterns in visual and other forms of media.[^manovich17cultural]

Contemporary analytics practices are deeply integrated into digital media technologies. Data analytics tools track user interactions, providing insights that influence content recommendation systems, targeted advertising, and search engine rankings. Platforms such as Google Analytics and social media insights dashboards help businesses and creators measure the impact of their content and refine their strategies accordingly.[^dong24study] In cultural analytics, computational methods allow researchers to examine trends in digital culture, such as the evolution of user-generated content to influence changes in interaction design across social media platforms.[^manovich17cultural]

Analytics profoundly impacts digital culture by shaping how content is created, distributed, and consumed. Algorithm-driven recommendations influence media consumption habits, raising concerns about data privacy, surveillance, and algorithmic bias.[^dong24study] Additionally, cultural analytics offers new ways to study digital culture, allowing researchers to map the evolution of aesthetic and social trends at an unprecedented scale.[^manovich17cultural]

## Commons 

Commons is a general term that refers to a resource shared by a group of people. These resources can range from small, localized systems (e.g., a family refrigerator) to community-level resources (e.g., sidewalks, playgrounds, libraries) and extend to global or transboundary systems (e.g., the deep seas, the atmosphere, the Internet, and scientific knowledge). The commons can be well-bounded (e.g., a community park or library), transboundary (e.g., the Danube River, migrating wildlife, the Internet), or without clear boundaries (e.g., knowledge, the ozone layer). [^hessOstrom]

The salient characteristic of commons, as opposed to property, is that no single person has exclusive control over the use and disposition of any particular resource in the commons. Instead, resources governed by commons may be used or disposed of by anyone among some (more or less well-defined) number of persons, under rules that may range from “anything goes” to quite crisply articulated formal rules that are effectively enforced. [^benkler]

The term “commons” originates from the English legal term for common land, historically used to describe shared agricultural or grazing lands. The modern conceptualization of the commons was popularized by ecologist Garrett Hardin in his 1968 article, [*The Tragedy of the Commons*](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.162.3859.1243). [^hardin] Hardin’s work highlighted the challenges of managing shared resources, sparking widespread academic and practical interest in the topic. Prior to Hardin’s article, references to “the commons,” “common pool resources,” or “common property” were rare in academic literature. [^laerhovenOstrom]

If we link this concept of the commons to new media, we can notice how the commons is now a foundational element to the philosophy of open-source software, crowdsourced projects, and decentralized technologies. All of these systems are based on emphasizing shared resources and collective governance to contribute to community resilience and prefigure better futures. [^smith] [Wikis](#wiki) are one of the most popular types of digital commons. An example of this would be [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/), which is a digital encyclopedia that relies on a collective of editors to modify or add information. [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) is another similar concept that provides crowdsourced geographic data.

## Git

Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other's contributions.[^chacon14progit]

Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. The name ”Git” is British slang for a foolish or worthless person, which Torvalds humorously acknowledged, stating, “I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself. First 'Linux', now 'git'.”[^torvalds05kernel]

In new media studies, Git is significant because it facilitates collaborative content creation and management. Its distributed nature allows creators from various locations to contribute to a project, promoting decentralized and collaborative workflows. This aligns with the principles of new media, which emphasize participatory culture and collective intelligence.[^jenkins06convergence]

Git underpins many modern development workflows and platforms. Services like [GitHub](../main/glossary.md#github), GitLab, and Bitbucket build upon Git to provide hosting, collaboration tools, and project management features. These platforms are integral to open-source projects, content management systems, and even digital art collaborations, reflecting Git's broad applicability in current media practices.

A paradigmatic example of Git use is the Linux Kernel Development. Git was initially developed by Linus Torvalds for managing the Linux kernel's source code. The original thread for defining the protocol is [still available](https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/4/6/121).

## GitHub
GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration using Git,[^github24wikis] allowing users to manage and share code in various repositories and offering wikis for documentation and collaborative editing. GitHub employs Git software, offering distributed version control, access control, bug tracking, feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and project [wikis](../main/glossary.md#wiki).[^kinsta24what]

As of 2020, GitHub is the most important platform for collaborative Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) development, with 31 million user accounts and over 100 million code repositories.[^zoller20topology] FLOSS development is associated with the idea of commons-based peer production, presenting it as a different approach to creating goods and services compared to traditional market or hierarchical methods. It is seen as a method for producing without the usual power imbalances.

GitHub's development process is distributed, allowing developers to collaborate, discuss, and comment on code from various locations. This platform generates a wealth of textual, numerical, and collaborative data, making it a prime source for software engineering research.[^seker20open]

## Hashtag

The Hashtag functions as a navigational tool that allows you to instantly search for publications on topics of interest. It also serves as a powerful tool for marketing promotion in the
social network of a product or service.[^budnik19dynamic] A hashtag typically consists of a string of characters preceded by the pound symbol.[^caleffi15word] It most commonly used as a method of sorting between various topics or categories within social media platforms. 

The person who invented and popularized the usage of the hashtag is credited to social designer Chris Messina, who produced the first ever hashtag on the social media platform Twitter (now X) in 2007. His first usage of it was when he posted a tweet reading: “how do you feel
about using # (pound) for groups. As in #barcamp?”.[^caleffi15word] However, the hashtag has also appeared during the 1990s in the messaging service IRC (Internet Relay Chat) for marking message topics, similar to the modern day usage.[^budnik19dynamic]

Within new media studies, the hashtag plays a very important role. Hashtags are now used in a number of ways, very often as a contextual aside to comment on, give more
depth to, or somehow emphasize what has been said. It is a reliable method for looking up specific posts or terms and has been utilized as an effective method of advertising and promotion.[^caleffi15word]

The hashtag has a profound impact on our society today, especially with the continuous rise of social media. Many social media platforms such as Twitter and Instagram have pushed the usage of the hashtag into mainstream digital advertising. Not only is the hashtag a tool, it represents an integral element of contemporary communication.[^rauschnabel19motivate]

## Middleware

Middleware is a type of software that can best be viewed as a layer between different systems and the outcome of their collaboration. Examples of these different systems are applications, databases, and operating systems. Examples of the outcomes of these systems’ collaboration are single sign-on (SSO) and API management. In other words, it simplifies the integration between various components to provide efficient and reliable services. [^1citation]

Middleware first made its appearance in a 1968 NATO Software Engineering report. Originally, the term designated the software that sat between application programs and service routines.[^2citation] Then, in the 1980s and 1990s, the exponential growth of the internet led to new middleware technologies being designed to support distributed systems. Today, middleware continues to be a term used to describe a wide range of services that are essential for building complex applications that are distributed.

By far, the most important role of middleware is in cloud computing. The foundation for modern cloud-native architecture is middleware. It allows developers to safely and efficiently scale applications across hybrid environments. The main advantage of middleware is that it creates reliable core application features rather than handling complex system interactions that are error prone. The main disadvantage is that the initial setup and maintenance of middleware systems can be complex.[^3citation]

In the 21st century, computing continues to evolve, thus the role of middleware is more important than ever. Done properly, middleware is a vital service that enable applications to communicate an across a wide range of platforms. Incorrectly chosen, middleware can slow down the process by producing bottleneck issues.

# Search Engine Optimization


Search Engine Optimization, also known as SEO, optimizes websites to help users find content faster and more efficiently. By developing SEO, websites are pushed to the top of the Search Engine Results Page (SERP), which allows users to engage with website content promptly. SEO also helps improve website traffic since users typically visit the top pages from their search query [^mailchimpSEO]. SEO is fundamental for web development since users rarely click on links found on the following result pages. 

Search Engine Optimization helps search engines understand the content on a website so it can process the information to help people discover content. SEO is widely used in new media for digital marketing purposes [^zilincanSEO]. To allow businesses to thrive and gain a lot of engagement with their clients they must be easily found through search engines. It helps to increase the customer base and website credibility as well. There are two types of SEO: on page and off-page optimization [^santhoshSEO]. On page delves into modifying the content and structure of a webpage like the schema and source code and adding content-specific keywords[^zilincanSEO]. Off-page SEO delves into gathering a user base from outside platforms to link to the targeted web page.

Search Engine Optimization is important in new media, since it shapes how users interact with digital content and determines what the user base sees. It structures content through SERPs and defines how it is interpreted within the digital space of the search engine[^mailchimpSEO].  SEO dictates how content is ranked, who can access it, and how algorithms influence its visibility and interpretation.

## Virtual Environment

Virtual environments are the technology which facilitates interactions between users and computer-generated artificial environments.[^ve3] These interactive computer displays are designed to create the illusion that the user has been transported to a different location.[^ve1] In a virtual world, the user can use their senses and their body in a similar way to the real world. They can turn their head to see their surroundings, trace sounds to the direction they are coming from, and use their hands to pick up virtual objects [^ve2]. Virtual environments are thus the most natural form of interaction between humans and computers.[^ve2]

## Wiki


Wikis are web-based, collaborative software that enables people to modify content by directly editing pages online.[^ebersbach05wiki] In educational contexts, they facilitate student engagement in a collaborative learning environment.[^parker07wiki]

The term "Wiki Wiki Web" was inspired by the "Wiki Wiki Shuttle" at Honolulu International Airport, as named by Ward Cunningham.[^anderson10wiki] In Hawaiian, "Wiki" means "quick" or "fast."

Wikis differ from traditional websites in that they are collaborative platforms that allow multiple users to create, edit, and organize content. Unlike traditional websites, wikis enable easy navigation between pages through interlinking and often have features such as revision history and discussion pages to track changes and facilitate communication among users. Wikis are commonly used for knowledge management, project collaboration, and intranet applications, and they can be utilized to display information, store corporate records, or serve as knowledge bases for various subjects. While traditional websites are typically front-end oriented, wikis act as a hybrid between an information system and an information displayer, allowing for quick and easy content creation and updates by users with minimal technical skills.[^hester09analysis]


There are numerous platforms for running wikis. Among the most popular are  [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/), [DokuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki), and [GitHub](../main/glossary.md#GitHub).
