# Glossary of keywords related to new media.

The following list of keywords related to new media is constantly updated by the CART210 community throughout the term.

Each student is responsible for choosing and maintaining a set of three keywords. You will research about, define, and exemplify these terms. Your task involves improving the concepts throughout the term. 

For each keyword, cite at least three references. Ensure that at least two of these are from **academic sources**, such as journal articles, books, or conference papers. Citations must follow the Chicago author-year format.

>[!IMPORTANT]
To make your contributions and suggest changes, follow the instructions in the repository's [README](https://github.com/concordia-dcart/CART210-glossary/blob/main/README.md) file.

## Git

Git is a free, [open source](#opensource.md), and dedicated [version control](#version_control.md) and source code management software. It was created in 2005, when Linus Torvalds, the same individual who initiated the development of the Linux kernel, and a group of volunteers working on its development had to quickly find a new version control system after a conflict happened with their previous source control management providers, BitKeeper. No longer being able to use this system without paying to use it, and with other free-to-use solutions not being able to fit their development needs, they instead created their own system.[^Geeksforgeeks-Git]

One of its main features is its ability to create branches[^Git-Git]; Different versions of the same code that are independant from each other, but still lets you copy the changes made in another branch into your own if needed. Another important feature is the staging state before a commit is fully completed, which allows you to select which changes will be included in a specific commit.

Examples of repository hosting platforms that use Git include:[^Opensource-Git]
- [GitHub](#github.md)
- GitLab
- Bitbucket
- SourceForge

## GitHub
GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration using Git,[^github24wikis] allowing users to manage and share code in various repositories and offering wikis for documentation and collaborative editing. GitHub employs Git software, offering distributed version control, access control, bug tracking, feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and project [wikis](../main/glossary.md#wiki).[^kinsta24what]

As of 2020, GitHub is the most important platform for collaborative Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) development, with 31 million user accounts and over 100 million code repositories.[^zoller20topology] FLOSS development is associated with the idea of commons-based peer production, presenting it as a different approach to creating goods and services compared to traditional market or hierarchical methods. It is seen as a method for producing without the usual power imbalances.

GitHub's development process is distributed, allowing developers to collaborate, discuss, and comment on code from various locations. This platform generates a wealth of textual, numerical, and collaborative data, making it a prime source for software engineering research.[^seker20open]

## Virtual Environment

Virtual environments are the technology which facilitates interactions between users and computer-generated artificial environments.[^ve3] These interactive computer displays are designed to create the illusion that the user has been transported to a different location.[^ve1] In a virtual world, the user can use their senses and their body in a similar way to the real world. They can turn their head to see their surroundings, trace sounds to the direction they are coming from, and use their hands to pick up virtual objects [^ve2]. Virtual environments are thus the most natural form of interaction between humans and computers.[^ve2]

## Wiki


Wikis are web-based, collaborative software that enables people to modify content by directly editing pages online.[^ebersbach05wiki] In educational contexts, they facilitate student engagement in a collaborative learning environment.[^parker07wiki]

The term "Wiki Wiki Web" was inspired by the "Wiki Wiki Shuttle" at Honolulu International Airport, as named by Ward Cunningham.[^anderson10wiki] In Hawaiian, "Wiki" means "quick" or "fast."

Wikis differ from traditional websites in that they are collaborative platforms that allow multiple users to create, edit, and organize content. Unlike traditional websites, wikis enable easy navigation between pages through interlinking and often have features such as revision history and discussion pages to track changes and facilitate communication among users. Wikis are commonly used for knowledge management, project collaboration, and intranet applications, and they can be utilized to display information, store corporate records, or serve as knowledge bases for various subjects. While traditional websites are typically front-end oriented, wikis act as a hybrid between an information system and an information displayer, allowing for quick and easy content creation and updates by users with minimal technical skills.[^hester09analysis]


There are numerous platforms for running wikis. Among the most popular are  [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/), [DokuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki), and [GitHub](../main/glossary.md#GitHub).
