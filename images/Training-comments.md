### TRAIN OBEY REPEAT
The text at the top of the composition talks about the repetitive way that modern training systems seem to be in,
wether they're in education, corporate environments, or AI development. It really means: Are we truly learning, or are we being conditioned?

### The Conveyor Belt of Programmed Humans
This dystopian looking belt represents the way training has become industrialized, and nowadays we have been treating people as products in an assembly line of compliance.
Schools, workplaces, and even social platforms work on standardized training models that normally discourage deviation from the system’s expectations.

### Eyes with Barcode [^www.scandit.com] Background
Surveillance and data extraction are seen a lot in modern training methodologies. Every lesson, action, and response is normally tracked, measured, and optimized,
not normally for personal growth, but for institutional control. The barcode background with the eye watching symbolizes how learners become data points, their progress monitored and manipulated.

### ARE YOU LEARNING OR BEING TRAINED
Learning means curiosity and creativity while training normally means obedience, standardization, and repetition. The question then becomes "who benefits from this distinction"?
