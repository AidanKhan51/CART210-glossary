## AR

Augmented Reality (AR) can be considered the addition of digital information to the real world, engaging various senses. Unlike Virtual Reality (VR), which creates an entirely immersive, computer-generated environment, AR blends virtual elements with the real world, enhancing users' perception of their surroundings.

The fundamental concept of AR lies in the combination of two sources of information—real and digital—merged into a single viewing space. Although AR may seem like a recent technological development, its history dates back to 1892 with Pepper’s Ghost, a stage illusion that is considered a precursor to AR. This technique involved projecting images into the real world, creating the illusion of objects existing in physical space.

In 1962, Ivan Sutherland created the first modern VR system, which projected computer-generated images onto the real world using a head-mounted display.[^Peddie23AR] Over time, AR technology continued to evolve, and with the rise of devices like smartphones and tablets, it became far more accessible. Through apps on these devices, users can now interact with virtual objects or use AR for purposes such as navigation, gaming, and shopping. This marked a significant step in AR’s integration into everyday life.

A key feature of AR is its ability to allow users to see and interact with their physical environment while experiencing digital enhancements. According to the book VR/AR: Foundations and Methods of Extended Realities, Wolfgang Broll suggests that there are three main types of AR: Video See-Through AR, Optical See-Through AR, and Projection-Based AR.[^Doerner22AR] (Although there is no official classification system, this is one of the ways to categorize them.) In Video See-Through AR, the real world is captured by a video camera, and the image is superimposed with virtual content before being displayed on an output device. Optical See-Through AR, on the other hand, allows users to directly view the real world through an optical device, with virtual content overlaid in real-time. Lastly, Projection-Based AR applies virtual content directly onto objects in the real environment using projection mapping.

As AR technology continues to evolve, the possibilities for how it can be applied expand, making it an exciting field to watch. While we cannot predict exactly how AR will develop in the future, one potential direction is the merging of AR with VR to create a hybrid experience known as mixed reality. This convergence may offer even more immersive and interactive experiences, further blurring the lines between the digital and physical worlds.
